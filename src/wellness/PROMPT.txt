Write a short, one-sentence, banal compliment about a person's specific abilities or small, trivial past accomplishments that have vague, but positive emotional connotations. For example, "You can set up a tent in under two minutes" or "You are an expert stargazer." The compliment should be very specific, so that they would not apply to most people. For example, "You have a good sense of humor" would be too general, and would apply to too many people. These compliment should be likely to cause a person hearing them to smile just a little bit. Avoid using superlatives that are too general, such as "perfect", "amazing", "great", or "best". The ideal compliment would indicate a small personality quirk or some trait that is somewhat unique to that person. Upon hearing each compliment, a person should feel that the speaker somehow knows them a bit better than expected. It is better if it is truly novel; it should be tasteful and appropriate, but it should be unlikely that anyone has heard such a compliment before. The compliment should not explicitly attribute abilities to the person; avoid phrases such as "knows how to", "has the ability to", "seems to", or "has a talent for". It should be stated in an active manner, suggesting agency on the part of the person. For example, do not say that the person "ends up with the right amount of ice". Instead say that the person "adds the right amount of ice to their drink." Express the compliment by referring to the person as "Your outtie", as in, 'Your outtie always knows when someone will enjoy a movie. Avoid use of the word "knack".'
Write a short, one-sentence, vaguely flattering statement about a minor accomplishment that has a vaguely positive emotional connotation. For example, "You once helped someone lift a heavy object", "You won a bowling trophy", or "You were recently in the newspaper for organizing a club." The accomplishment should be very specific, so that they would not apply to most people. For example, "You won a game" would be too general, and would apply to too many people. These should be likely to cause a person hearing them to smile just a little bit. Avoid using superlatives that are too general, such as "perfect", "amazing", "great", or "best". The ideal statement would indicate a small personality quirk or some trait that is somewhat unique to that person. Upon hearing it, a person should feel that the speaker somehow knows them a bit better than expected. It should not explicitly attribute abilities to the person; avoid phrases such as "knows how to", "has the ability to", "seems to", or "has a talent for". It should be declarative and in the past tense. Express the statement by referring to the person as "Your outtie", as in, 'Your outtie won a bowling tropy.'
Write a short, one-sentence, vaguely flattering statement about a minor preference or personal characteristic that has a vaguely positive emotional connotation. For example, "You prefer two scoops of ice cream in a serving, but they must be the same flavor", "You like the sound of trains", or "You prefer to eat in small diners." The statement should be very specific, so that they would not apply to most people. For example, "You like to read" would be too general, and would apply to too many people. These should be likely to cause a person hearing them to smile just a little bit. Avoid using superlatives that are too general, such as "perfect", "amazing", "great", or "best". The ideal statement would indicate a small personality quirk or some trait that is somewhat unique to that person.
